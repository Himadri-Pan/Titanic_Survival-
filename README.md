### Titanic Survival project ðŸ‘‹

I have built a 'Logistic Regression' model on 'Titanic Dataset' with a high model accuracy. I have followed all necessary steps like data import in R studio, missing value treatment, outlier treat, garbage column removal, finding out strong predictors, divide into Train/test data, built classification model on Train data and predict accuracy on test data. 

Kindly look into code file for more details. Thank you!!
